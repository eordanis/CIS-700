Stephanie:
			1. Reworked original code to save data to common directory,
			using unique naming for ease of compartmentalized running and testing
			2. Restructured report for use with M2
			3. Added cGan model to code as per M2 requirement and discussed it
			4. Added new components to use more visual comparisions using csv data generation from trainings
				a. added visuals with metric charts and plotted side by side
                                b. cleaned up code and took test text files for synthetic data generated and put into dataframes for a more visual experience
                        5. Generic code cleanup in files, removed residual hard coded epoch setters so that all files make use of main GAN setter
